abstract: Digital Collectible Cards Games such as Hearthstone have become a very prolific
  test-bed for Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The main researches have focused
  on the implementation of autonomous agents (bots) able to effectively play the game.
  However, this environment is also very attractive for the use of Data Mining (DM)
  and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, for analysing and extracting useful knowledge
  from game data. The objective of this work is to apply existing Game Mining techniques
  in order to study more than 600,000 real decks (groups of cards) created by players
  with many different skill levels. Data visualisation and analysis tools have been
  applied, namely, Graph representations and Clustering techniques. Then, an expert
  player has conducted a deep analysis of the results yielded by these methods, aiming
  to identify the use of standard - and well-known - archetypes defined by the play
  methods will also make it possible for the expert to discover hidden relationships
  between cards that could lead to finding better combinations of them, enhancing
  players’ decks or, otherwise, identify unbalanced cards that could lead to a disappointing
  game experience. Moreover, although this work is mostly focused on data analysis
  and visualization, the obtained results can be applied to improve Hearthstone Bots’
  behaviour, e.g. predicting opponent’s actions after identifying a specific archetype
  in his/her deck.
