Since the time I worked on my Master project, I have always had an interest in artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to gaming. I first had the opportunity of developing this interest in 2014, through a collaboration with the [GeNeura team](https://geneura.wordpress.com/) from University of Granada, Spain, funded by the [Granada Excellence Network of Innovation Laboratories](https://genil.ugr.es/?lang=en). With [Pablo Garcia Sanchez](https://www.ugr.es/~pablogarcia/), we developed algorithms for machine learning (ML) applied to real-time strategy games such as [StarCraft](https://starcraft.com/en-gb/), and collectible card games such as [HearthStone](https://playhearthstone.com/en-gb). An AI based on [Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) that we developed obtained 2nd place in the [2018 HearthStone AI competition](https://hearthstoneai.github.io/).

With [Giovanni Squillero](https://staff.polito.it/giovanni.squillero/) from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, I co-supervised the Ph.D. project of [Marco Gaudesi](https://it.linkedin.com/in/marco-gaudesi-63390622), focused on learning the opponent's behavior in the [Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma).
