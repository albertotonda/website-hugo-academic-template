## Silver medal at the HUMIES awards, GECCO 2022

On July 13th, 2022, I had the pleasure of receiving the Silver Medal at the HUMIES ([human-competitive awards](https://www.human-competitive.org/)) held in Boston, MA, USA. The prize was awarded for a human-competitive result obtained using evolutionary computation. Me and my collaborators (Eric Claassen, Etienne Coz, Johan Garssen, Aletta D. Kraneveld, Alejandro Lopez Rincon, Lucero Mendoza Maldonado, Carmina A. Perez Romero, Patrick Tabeling, Jessica Vanhomwegen) worked on the [automatic discovery of primers for virus, with a specific application to COVID-19]({{< relref "/publication/lopez-rincon-2021-b/index.md" >}}).
