## Invited talk at ENCALS 2022

On June 3rd, 2022, I had the pleasure of giving an invited talk at the first Non-Coding RNA in Motor Neuron Diseases (MND) and Amyothropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Internation Symposium, a side event of the [European Network to Cure ALS (ENCALS) 2022 conference](https://encals.eu/meetings/encals-meeting-2022-edinburgh-scotland/) in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.

The subject of my talk was feature selection of microRNA biomarkers to help machine learning robustly classifying diseases. The application I presented is cancer classification, based on a [2020 work in cooperation with Alejandro Lopez-Rincon and several other authors](/publication/lopez-rincon-2020/index.md). The technique proposed in the study, Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection, can in principle be applied to datasets from other diseases, and during the symposium we discussed the possibility of applying it to an ALS dataset.

I would like to thank all the ENCALS organizing committee, and in particular [Prof. Ana Cristina Calvo](https://tricals.org/en/researchers/ana-cristina-calvo), for the kind invite and the productive interactions.
